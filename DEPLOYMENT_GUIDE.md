# üöÄ Streamlit Cloud Deployment Guide

## Deployment Status
Your app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud!

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Python Version Compatibility**
- **Problem**: Streamlit Cloud was using Python 3.13, but TensorFlow 2.13 doesn't support it
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `.python-version` file specifying Python 3.11
  - Created `runtime.txt` with `python-3.11`
  - Both files force the deployment to use Python 3.11

### 2. **Dependency Version Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Pinned versions (numpy==1.24.3, tensorflow==2.13.1) caused conflicts
- **Solution**: Used flexible version ranges:
  ```
  numpy>=1.23.0,<1.25.0
  tensorflow>=2.13.0,<2.14.0
  keras>=2.13.0,<2.14.0
  ```

### 3. **System Dependencies**
- **Added**: `packages.txt` with system libraries needed for OpenCV, audio, etc.
  ```
  ffmpeg
  libsm6
  libxext6
  libxrender-dev
  libgomp1
  libglib2.0-0
  ```

### 4. **Streamlit Configuration**
- **Created**: `.streamlit/config.toml` with:
  - Cyberpunk theme colors matching your UI
  - 200MB max upload size
  - Security settings enabled

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:
- `.python-version` - Forces Python 3.11
- `runtime.txt` - Platform compatibility
- `packages.txt` - System dependencies
- `.streamlit/config.toml` - App configuration

### Modified Files:
- `requirements.txt` - Flexible version ranges
- `README.md` - Updated branding to NexusAI Analytics Studio
- `run2.py` - Already updated with new branding

## Deployment Steps

1. **Your changes are already pushed to GitHub** ‚úÖ

2. **Go to Streamlit Cloud Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://share.streamlit.io/
   - Click "Reboot" on your app (nexusai-pro)
   - OR delete and redeploy the app

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check that Python 3.11 is being used
   - Monitor the logs for successful installation
   - First deployment may take 5-10 minutes

## Expected Deployment Log

You should see:
```
üêô Cloning repository...
üì¶ Processing dependencies...
Using Python 3.11.x environment
Installing packages from requirements.txt...
‚úÖ All packages installed successfully
üöÄ Starting up repository: 'ict', branch: 'main', main module: 'run2.py'
```

## Troubleshooting

### If TensorFlow Still Fails:
Some AI features may need to be optional. Consider adding error handling:
```python
try:
    from deepface import DeepFace
    DEEPFACE_AVAILABLE = True
except:
    DEEPFACE_AVAILABLE = False
```

### If Memory Issues Occur:
Streamlit Cloud has memory limits. Consider:
- Lazy loading of heavy models
- Using smaller model variants
- Implementing caching with `@st.cache_resource`

### Alternative: Lighter Requirements
If deployment still fails, you can create `requirements-lite.txt`:
```
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=1.4.0
plotly>=5.0.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.5.0
Pillow>=9.0.0
textblob>=0.17.0
nltk>=3.8.0
wordcloud>=1.8.0
# Exclude heavy ML libraries for basic functionality
```

## App URLs

- **Streamlit Cloud**: https://nexusai-pro.streamlit.app/
- **GitHub Repo**: https://github.com/jaideep-27/ict
- **Local Dev**: http://localhost:8501

## Features That Will Work

‚úÖ **Guaranteed to work:**
- Text Analytics (TextBlob, NLTK, WordCloud)
- Story Insights (all NLP features)
- Basic Image Analysis (OpenCV, Pillow)
- Video playback and basic analysis
- All UI features and styling

‚ö†Ô∏è **May have limitations on Cloud:**
- DeepFace (face detection) - memory intensive
- Background removal (rembg) - large model
- Audio processing (librosa) - may be slower
- TensorFlow models - memory dependent

## Monitoring

Watch the deployment logs at:
https://share.streamlit.io/

Look for:
- ‚úÖ Green checkmarks = success
- ‚ùå Red X = errors to fix
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings = non-critical issues

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when you see:
1. "Your app is live!" message
2. Can access the app URL
3. UI loads with cyberpunk theme
4. Sidebar shows all 5 analysis modes
5. File uploaders work
