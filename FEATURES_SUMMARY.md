- Check internet connection
- Verify text is not empty
- Try shorter text segments

**STT shows "could not understand":**
- Audio may be unclear or music-only
- Check if audio contains speech
- Try converting to WAV format
- Reduce background noise

**Libraries not found:**
```bash
source streamlit_env/bin/activate
pip install gtts SpeechRecognition
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

You can now:
1. ✅ Analyze CSV data (run.py)
2. ✅ Analyze videos, text, and audio (run2.py)
3. ✅ Convert text to speech
4. ✅ Transcribe audio to text

**Both apps are running simultaneously on the same port (one at a time)!**

To switch between apps:
```bash
# For CSV analysis
streamlit run run.py

# For unstructured data (video/text/audio + TTS/STT)
streamlit run run2.py
```
